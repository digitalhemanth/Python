#Classes in Python


'''A class is a blueprint for the object.'''

'''
We can think of class as an sketch of a parrot with labels. It contains all the details about the name, 
colors, size etc. Based on these descriptions, we can study about the parrot.
Here, parrot is an object.
'''

#The example for class of parrot can be :

class Parrot:
    pass
'''
Here, we use class keyword to define an empty class Parrot. From class, we construct instances.
 An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.
