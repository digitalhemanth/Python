#Object

'''An object (instance) is an instantiation of a class.
 When class is defined, only the description for the object is defined.
  Therefore, no memory or storage is allocated.
  '''

#The example for object of parrot class can be:

         # obj = Parrot()

#Here, obj is object of class Parrot.

'''Suppose we have details of parrot. Now, we are going to show how to build the 
class and objects of parrot.
