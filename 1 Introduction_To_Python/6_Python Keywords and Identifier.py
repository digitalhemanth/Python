#Python Keywords and Identifier

''' Keywords are the reserved words in Python.

We cannot use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier.
They are used to define the syntax and structure of the Python language.'''

''' There are 33 keywords in Python 3.3. This number can vary slightly in course of time. 

False	class	finally	is	return
None	continue	for	lambda	try
True	def	from	nonlocal	while
and	del	global	not	with
as	elif	if	or	yield
assert	else	import	pass	 
break	except	in	raise

#Python Identifiers 

''' Identifier is the name given to entities like class, functions, variables etc. in Python. 
It helps differentiating one entity from another.''' 

#Rules for writing identifiers
'''
1.Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_). Names like myClass, var_1 and print_this_to_screen, all are valid example.
2.An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is perfectly fine.
3.Keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
4.We cannot use special symbols like !, @, #, $, % etc. in our identifier.
5.Identifier can be of any length.
