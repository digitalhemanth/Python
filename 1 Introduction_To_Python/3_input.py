#this code will take the input from the user 

'''Up till now, our programs were static. 
The value of variables were defined or hard coded into the source code.

To allow flexibility we might want to take the input from the user. In Python,
 we have the input() function to allow this. '''
 
 #The syntax for input() is


E_Name = input("please enter your name ")
print("Helo"+" "+ E_Name +"\n"+"Welcome to python coding")
E_contact = input("please enter your contact Number ")
print(E_contact)
